# ProdigyHax
This is a little side project of mine to bring back prodigy hacks.

To get the hacks running copy the JS, open prodigy and login. When your fully in press ctrl shift j to open the console then paste the code and press enter. if the console wont let you paste and gives a warning just type allow pasting then press enter then paste the code.
Currently only 2 hacks work and the second one is client sided sadly.
