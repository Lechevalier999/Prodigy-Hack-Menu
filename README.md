# How to setup the hack menu
Copy the raw file code of ProdigyHax javascript file (CheatMenuConsoleScript), Go on prodigy, Login and Select a world. 
Once you fully load in, open the browser console with either ctrl-shift-j or ctrl-shift-i and paste the script into the console with ctrl-v then press enter fill out the prompts then close the console and your good to go! If it does not let you paste type "allow pasting" enter this then paste the script again.
