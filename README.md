# ProdigyHax
Welcome to ProdigyHax this is a easy to use cheat menu for the math game Prodigy 
the hack scripts are not made by me but I edited them so they work!

# How to setup the hack menu
Copy the raw file code of ProdigyHax javascript file Go on prodigy, Login and Select a world. 
Once you fully load in, open the browser console with either ctrl-shift-j or ctrl-shift-i and paste the script into the console with ctrl-v then press enter fill out the prompts then close the console and your good to go! If it does not let you paste type "allow pasting" enter this then paste the script again.

# Change Log

ProdigyHax | Updated Version 0.5 => Version 0.6
1. added a robust "hide menu completely / restore" feature.
2. cleaned/beautified code.

# Future plans
Gonna be making it pull from a replit server of mine to decrease menu script size to prevent lag for potato pc's/laptops and also allow my neural network to find new ways to exploit in prodigy
