How do I get the hack to work?
To get the hacks running copy the JavaScript from the code file, open prodigy and login. When your fully in press ctrl shift j to open the console then paste the code and press enter. if the console wont let you paste and gives a warning just type allow pasting then press enter then paste the JavaScript.

Will I have to put different scripts into different places for the menu to show?
The UI and hacks are fully coded in JavaScript and, does not require HTML so its easier to use its all one big script just copy paste and enjoy.
